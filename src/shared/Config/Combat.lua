-- Combat (ModuleScript, ReplicatedStorage.Shared.Config.Combat)
-- Combat numbers, shared by CombatService / PedService (server) and CombatClient / PedClient (client).
-- Fists and guns, kid-safe: nothing gory, and nobody is ever gone for good. Hits fill a
-- server-owned damage meter (player attribute "Daze", 0-100) that every screen shows as HEALTH
-- (100 - Daze) and that heals by itself. At 0 health you are KNOCKED OUT for a few seconds (the same
-- fall and dizzy stars as a car bump), drop part of your robbery bag and a small wallet, and get up.
-- ARMOR (attribute "Armor", 0-100, bought at the shop) soaks up damage before health does.
--   * Citizens: Fists (free) and the guns in Combat.GunOrder, bought once at Coast Arms.
--   * Cops: the taser (ArrestService) and a free Service Pistol that only works on wanted citizens.
-- Helpers (attributes only, safe on both sides; the server re-checks everything itself):
--   Combat.Hittable(player, serverNow) -> can this player be hit right now?
--   Combat.Gun(id)                     -> the gun table, or nil for anything that isn't a gun id
--   Combat.ToolGun(tool)               -> the gun table of a gun Tool (its GunId attribute), or nil
--   Combat.Health(player)              -> 0..100
--   Combat.ArmorOf(player)             -> 0..100
--   Combat.Owns(player, id)            -> does the "Guns" attribute list this gun?
--   Combat.RankOk(player, gun)         -> free-roam rank high enough to buy it?
--   Combat.DamageAt(gun, distance)     -> damage of one pellet at this distance (whole number, 1 or more)
--   Combat.SpreadDir(dir, degrees, rng) -> a unit vector picked evenly inside a cone around dir
--   Combat.Stats(gun)                  -> damage, fire rate, range as 0..1 (the shop's three bars)
-- How it looks: a gun is held low in both hands, comes up to the eye while you aim or fire and goes
-- back down for the reload; fists throw a straight right, then a left. No uploaded animations: every
-- CombatClient shows it with PoseClient's poses ("LowReady", "Aim", "Point"): on your own character
-- straight from your camera and trigger, on everyone else's from the three look-only Tool attributes
-- below (the server sets them: from each shot and swing, and from what that player's device says about
-- its aim). Without PoseClient the plain Roblox tool hold and the old slash swing show.
-- (The guns' shapes aren't in here: CombatService builds each gun Tool from the place's own mesh,
-- ServerStorage.GunModels.<Model or Id>, and from a few parts when the place has none.)
