-- CombatService (ModuleScript, ServerScriptService.Services.CombatService)
-- Fists and guns, kid-safe: nothing gory, and nobody is ever gone for good. People are KNOCKED OUT and
-- get back up. Numbers live in Config.Combat. The client only asks; every hit is decided here.
--   * Tools (given on spawn, side change, purchase; checked again every 2 s):
--       citizens  "Fists" (everyone) + every gun they own (Combat.GunOrder: Pistol, SMG, Shotgun, Rifle),
--                 bought once at Coast Arms and saved as data.gear.guns[id] = true. An old Stun Blaster
--                 (data.gear.blaster) becomes the Pistol.
--       cops      the "Service Pistol" only (free; it only works on citizens with 2+ stars). They keep
--                 their taser (ArrestService).
--       prisoners and anyone in passive mode: nothing.
--     A gun Tool has a Handle, an Attachment "Muzzle" at the barrel tip (its -Z points out of the
--     barrel) holding a ParticleEmitter "Flash" (a short flame burst) and a PointLight "Light"
--     (CombatClient fires them), and the attributes NCCombat = "Gun", GunId, Ammo (rounds in the
--     magazine, owned here), ReloadUntil (server time), AimPitch (degrees) and AimUp (true while
--     raised). Fists carry Swing (a count of accepted swings).
--     How a gun looks: the place's own mesh, ServerStorage.GunModels.<Pistol | SMG | Shotgun | Rifle>
--     (the Service Pistol shares "Pistol"). Those models are used as the mesh generator left them: one
--     MeshPart ("body_geom"), the whole gun, upright, its barrel along the part's Z axis, nothing marked
--     on it. A copy of that part IS the Handle; Tool.Grip (where the hand holds it) and the Muzzle are
--     worked out from its size, and which end is the barrel is measured once with a few rays
--     (measureMesh; the shop's wall shows the same meshes). Optional attributes on a model put it
--     right by hand: BarrelZ (1 | -1), Grip (CFrame), Muzzle (Vector3); see meshGun. A model rigged the
--     old way (a "Handle" part: -Z = barrel, +Y = up, plus a "Muzzle" attachment) is used as it is.
--     Only when the place has no model for a gun is it built from a few Parts (GUN_BUILD).
--     AimPitch / AimUp / Swing are looks only: every other player's CombatClient shows that player's
--     arms from them (gun low, gun up and where it points, a straight right or left). A shot raises
--     the gun; the player's own device says the rest ("Aim" below). A gun the server raised for a shot
--     comes down again by itself 1.2 s after the last one, unless that device has said it is aiming.
--   * CombatAction remote (client -> server), 25 a second at most:
--       ("Punch", suggestedVictim?)                 nearest valid player 7 studs in front, no wall between
--       ("Fire", gunId, aimPoint, suggestedVictim?) one shot: rays from your head toward the aim point
--       ("Reload", gunId)                           refills the magazine after the gun's reload time
--       ("Aim", pitchDegrees, raised)               where the gun in hand points (looks only; its own
--                                                   limit of 10 a second, outside the 25)
--     A shot is checked in this order: the gun is in your hand, alone (two Tools held at once by an
--     exploit never fire or punch), and belongs to your side; it has been in the hand for 0.12 s
--     (Config DrawTime x 0.6: swapping guns never stacks their fire rates); you may fight right now
--     (not seated, swimming, passive, down, in a safe zone or spawn-protected); the magazine isn't
--     empty or reloading; the gun's own fire-rate limit (1.15x its rate; a gun with no burst, the
--     shotgun, may instead fire up to 0.15 s early, for jittery phone taps) and one limit shared by
--     all guns (14 a second with 3 in hand: what the fastest gun alone may do). Then the server
--     spreads the pellets itself (its own Random), casts each one (walls, doors and smoke block; hats
--     and dropped cash don't), and may accept the target the client picked when the shot passed within
--     a few studs of them (lag). Damage falls off past 60% of the range. Unequipping cancels a reload;
--     each Tool keeps its rounds.
--   * Health and armor: attribute "Daze" (0-100) is the damage taken, shown as HEALTH = 100 - Daze. It
--     heals 15 a second after 4 s without a hit. "Armor" (0-100, citizens only, saved as
--     data.gear.armor, bought at Coast Arms) soaks up damage first, fists included.
--     At 0 health you're knocked out (ImpactService.KnockDown, 5 s on the ground), health refills, and
--     you're immune to combat for 10 s after getting up (attribute CombatSafeUntil, server time; firing
--     a shot or landing a hit ends it early).
--     Swimmers can't fall over: they stay at 5 health and the next hit once they're out of the water
--     does it. "Swimming" means the Swimming humanoid state (which the player's own device reports) AND
--     terrain water at their body, so faking the state on land does nothing.
--     Bailing out mid-fight (the Reset button, a side switch, leaving) counts as being knocked out: the
--     bag and wallet still drop and the attacker gets the heat and the bounty (going by what you were
--     when last hit). Getting arrested mid-fight doesn't: the cops already took the bag.
--   * Money from a knockout:
--       - Bag: carrying $50+ in the robbery bag, 25% of it (at least $50) drops as a glowing duffel.
--       - Wallet: a citizen also drops 2% of their Cash ($20-$400) as a small wallet, at most once
--         every 120 s per victim (never when leaving the game: their save is already being written).
--       - Both lie in Workspace.DroppedBags for 60 s. Citizens on foot grab them into their own bag (+1
--         heat when it isn't theirs); a cop returns them to the bank (the money is gone; evidence reward up
--         to $100, never more than half). Walking over one only picks it up for its owner, cops and
--         wanted players. Models carry the attributes Kind ("Bag" | "Wallet") and Amount.
--       - Bounty: knocking out a WANTED citizen pays their PAID stars x $200 from the system (cops:
--         "ko_bounty", citizens: "vigilante"), once per wanted spell (WantedSince) and at most once per
--         victim every 5 minutes. Fight stars pay nothing, so friends can't fire into the air and farm
--         each other, and a friend who stays wanted can't be knocked out for cash over and over.
--   * Heat (all through combatHeat, counted in CombatStars; fists and stolen pickups give at most 2 stars,
--     guns at most 3): knocking out someone who isn't wanted +1, a cop +2; the first hit on a cop +1
--     right away; firing a gun where someone hears it +1 at most every 20 s (within 70 studs of a road's
--     centre line, or 150 studs of a player cop or patrol car; not while defending yourself).
--     Knocking out a wanted player (vigilante) or whoever threw the first hit (self-defence): no heat.
--     Cops never start a "fight" in that sense: shooting back at a cop is never self-defence.
--   * No combat for or against: prisoners, anyone in a car, in passive mode, in a safe zone, within 20 s
--     of spawning or leaving their home (SpawnSafeUntil), already down, tasered or immune. Crewmates
--     can't hit each other. Swimmers can't attack (they can't be knocked out, so it would be one-sided).
--   * Safe zones (attribute InSafeZone, checked twice a second): 60 studs around team spawns, the
--     Hideout and Police HQ; dealerships (+20), homes (+10) and anyone inside one (InHome); the Car Meet
--     lot; Coast Arms (+10). Zone boxes are cached and rebuilt when those folders change.
--   * Passive mode (phone SETTINGS -> SettingsService -> CombatService.RequestPassive): refused while
--     wanted, carrying a bag, hurt, down, just after swinging or firing, or on duty as a cop; 60 s before
--     turning it back on, 10 s before turning it off. Getting heat or a bag, or starting a crime (Rob,
--     Prep, Pick lock), turns it off by itself. Saved as data.settings.Passive.
--   * Coast Arms: the gun store built at start-up (Workspace.Shops.GunShop). Its counter has one prompt
--     ("GunShopBrowse"); CombatClient opens the shop panel from it. Remote GunShopBuy(itemId: a gun id or
--     "Armor"): citizen, at the counter, not owned / armor not full, rank, cash.
-- Player attributes set here: Daze, Armor, Guns ("Pistol,Rifle"; nil until the save loads), Passive,
-- InSafeZone, SpawnSafeUntil, CombatSafeUntil, CombatStars.
-- Remote CombatFx (server -> client): "Hit", "Punch", "Shot", "HitMark", "Reload", "KO", "KOd", "Fled",
