--                                          (always owned); pass / unlock paints are free once allowed
--   RequestUnderglow(id, glowIndex)     -> $3,000 the first time on a car, then colour changes are free
--   RequestRims(id, rimIndex)           -> Garage.RimPrice ($1,500) once per rim style per car, same rules;
--                                          Garage.StockRim (Chrome) is always owned

--   RequestTune(id, trackKey, stage?)   -> buys that track's next stage (Config.Garage.Tune: the price
--                                          scales with the car's tier). stage: the stage the phone's

--                                          (Garage.AutoTunePlan), in one payment. budget: the total the
--                                          phone's confirm line showed, so it never spends more than that.
--                                          have: the stages the car had when the phone worked out its
--                                          plan; if the car has moved on, nothing is bought.
--   Asking twice: on a slow connection the phone gives up waiting (PhoneUI's FITTING...) and the player
--   confirms again; then both requests arrive. The second must not buy the NEXT, dearer thing nobody saw
--   a price for, so the phone says what it expects (stage / have) and a request that no longer matches
--   is dropped without a word. Both are optional (the Studio test hook fires without them). An exhaust
--   asked for twice is safe as it is: the second finds it fitted.
--   Tuning is for land cars you own: never boats, police cars or street cars (Garage.CanTune), not in
--   prison, and not while wanted and seen ("TuneWanted").
-- Picking the paint or rims a car already has costs nothing (ignored). Boats can't be customised: the
-- hull keeps its own textured colours (CarBuilder.attachBoatBody), has no wheels for rims and never shows
-- underglow, so all three requests are ignored for boats (the phone has no STYLE button for them).
-- Pass cars count as owned while the player has attribute "Pass_<PassName>" (set by the shop, step 4.5);
-- cop-rank cars while "CopRank" >= UnlockCopRank.
-- The saved owned list is mirrored to the player attribute "OwnedCars" (comma list) for the phone UI, and
-- customisations to "Custom_<id>" attributes ("paint,glow,rim", 0 = default) and "Style_<id>" (the paints
-- and rims bought for that car: "3,5;2"). Pass and cop-rank cars are
-- not in OwnedCars: the phone and the dealer card add them from the Pass_ / CopRank attributes.
-- A car's tune is mirrored to "Tune_<id>" ("E2,T1,B0,G1,N2|Muscle|Sport,Muscle": Config.Garage explains
-- it and has the parser), only for cars that have one.
-- Answers go back on GarageResult: { Kind = "Bought" | "Painted" | "Rims" | "Glow", Id, Name = the paint /
--   rim / glow's name, Bought = true when that pick cost money }, and for tuning
--   { Kind = "Tuned", Id, Track, Stage, Price }, { Kind = "Exhaust", Id, Key, Bought = bool, Price },
--   { Kind = "AutoTuned", Id, Total, Count, Text = "Engine 2, Turbo 1", Tracks = { [trackKey] = stage } }.
-- GarageService.ApplyCustom(car, player, restore?) dresses a freshly spawned car (VehicleService and
-- HousingService call it with two arguments): paint, rims, underglow, and the tune. restore = "Paints" /
-- "Rims" only when that was just changed on a car that's already out: back to stock then puts the stock
-- colour back on (a fresh car already has it). Tuned numbers go onto the car's attributes MaxSpeed, Accel, Brake, Grip,
-- TireFriction and NitroSeconds, always worked out from Config.Vehicles' stock values (so they never pile
-- up) and only for tracks with a stage bought (a stock car keeps exactly what its template has).
-- Tunable cars also get "Exhaust" (the fitted key, "Stock" by default; SoundClient turns it into sound)
-- and "TuneStage" (stages bought, 0-12, for other players' UI). After a tune purchase the player's live
-- car gets the new numbers at once. A car delivered before its owner's save had loaded (VehicleService
-- waits JoinWait seconds at most) is dressed again the moment the save arrives.
-- Speed checks that look at a car (VehicleGuard, RaceService, DriftService, StuntService, AIPoliceService)
-- read its MaxSpeed attribute, so they follow a tune by themselves. MissionService and EventService have
-- no car to look at: their anti-teleport timers (MAX_TRAVEL) must allow the fastest car there can be,
-- fully tuned and on nitro. Config.Garage.MaxGain("MaxSpeed") is the tune's share of that (its header
-- has the sum: 297 studs/s today, where the fastest stock car on nitro does 258).
-- GarageService.TuneOf(player, id) -> the saved tune as a Config.Garage tune table.
-- Goal events (ProgressService.Event): "BuyCar" after a car or boat is bought, "Paint" after a colour (not
-- stock) goes on a car, "Tune" after any tune purchase (amount = stages bought: 1, or more for AUTO TUNE;
-- 1 for an exhaust).
