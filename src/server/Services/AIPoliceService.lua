-- AIPoliceService (ModuleScript, ServerScriptService.Services.AIPoliceService)
-- AI patrol cars keep crime exciting when few players are cops.
--   * Only while fewer than 2 player cops are online and patrolling (a cop away from the keys doesn't
--     count: ArrestService.IsActiveCop). Per wanted player: 1 car at 1-2 stars (only if there are no
--     such player cops at all), then 3 cars at 3 stars, 4 at 4 and 5 at 5 (CARS_BY_STARS; owner, Nov 4:
--     "If you have 3 stars, I think there should be more cops trying to get you"; it was 2, 3 and 3).
--     From 3 stars they come SPAWN_GAP_HOT seconds apart instead of SPAWN_GAP, so they arrive as a pack.
--     Coast Guard boats keep the old count (heat - 1, max 3). At most MAX_TOTAL in the server.
--     (The police helicopter that joins at 5 stars is PoliceHeliService's.)
--   * Head start: no patrol comes until the player has been wanted (WantedSince, set by HeatService)
--     for 20 s at 1 star, 14 s at 2, 8 s at 3, 4 s at 4+ (well inside HeatService's 30 + 10 x heat s
--     escape timer, so patrols get time to search). While waiting, the player attribute
--     PoliceETA (server time) says when they'll come, so the objective banner can count down.
--   * They spawn on a road 350-600 studs away (600-900 if there's none), out of the target's sight
--     when possible, follow the RoadGraph toward the target, and switch to direct pursuit once they
--     are close or can see the target. Where no road is in either ring (e.g. out on Lighthouse Key)
--     they use the road node nearest 350 studs that is at least 150 away, so no spot is a free escape.
--   * They never go faster than 95% of the target's car, so a good driver can always escape.
--   * Stuck (slow for 2 s) -> reverse and turn; upside down -> flipped back.
--   * They are cop "eyes" for HeatService, and arrest a wanted player who stays stopped (car under
--     8 studs/s, or on foot under 10) within 22 studs (and under ARREST_RISE above or below: not
--     through a floor) for about 3 seconds. They park a car length away instead of shoving the target.
--   * They leave when the target is no longer wanted, leaves, or they fall 900+ studs behind for 15 s.
--   * Reset Character is no way out: a target whose body goes down by itself with a patrol close by is
--     arrested (ArrestService.GaveUp). Further away the patrols leave and new ones find the new body.
--   * Officers (PoliceOfficerService): one rides in each car, two from 3 stars. Once the car pulls up
--     next to a suspect on foot or in a stopped car they get out and do the arresting (or the shooting)
--     on foot, and the car waits with its brakes on; they get back in when the suspect drives off. A car
--     whose officers are all down or dead stays put for GONE_WAIT seconds, then goes (a new one comes).
--     Without officers (their looks not built yet) the car arrests by itself, as it always did.
--   * Coast Guard (owner, Nov 4: wanted on the water, a cop that can drive on water comes and arrests you,
--     so the sea is no easy way out). A wanted player sitting in a boat that floats, or in the sea itself
--     where it is SEA_DEPTH+ deep, is "at sea" (atSea): the patrol cars leave, as they always did for a
--     boat, and Coast Guard boats come instead, as many as cars would and after the same head start. A boat
--     run up on the sand is not at sea: patrol cars come for it and their officers cuff the driver (sitting
--     in a beached boat used to keep every patrol away). The prison moat (6.5 deep) is too shallow for
--     them: a swimmer there still gets the patrol cars.
--     They are the Harbor Patrol boat player cops drive, named AICoastGuard (attribute CoastGuard), with
--     the AIPolice / AITarget attributes of a patrol car, so sirens, lights, minimap blips, hands up and
--     Reset Character all treat them as police. They appear in open water CG_SPAWN_DEPTH+ deep with nothing
--     over it, 350-600 studs off (then 600-900, then 150-350), and steer straight at the target, leading
--     it. Held to 95% of the target's top speed like the cars (their own top speed is CG_TOP, over every
--     boat's, so that rule decides even against the fastest one).
--     Arrest: a boat slower than CG_SLOW, or anyone in the water, within CG_ARREST_RANGE (flat) for
--     ARREST_SECONDS. A boat's driver sees the BEING CUFFED bar (PoliceOfficerService.BoatCuff: "DRIVE to
--     break free"); a swimmer gets the CoastGuardSwim toast instead (there's no swimming away from a boat).
--     The officers ride along and stay aboard. Aground away from the target: back off and turn; aground
--     CG_STRANDED s, stuck CG_STUCK_TRIES times in a row, or 900+ studs behind for 15 s: it goes and a new
--     one comes in open water. Target ashore: it waits where it is, still watching, for CG_LINGER s, then
--     goes, and the patrol cars take over. The target hears about it once a chase (Notify "CoastGuard").
-- Server-owned physics (CarPhysics) so VehicleGuard never checks them. They have to stay server-owned:
-- welding a rider in or out puts a car back on automatic ownership, the nearest player's device takes it
-- over, and the server's suspension forces reach it late, so it bounces and flips down the road (drive
-- takes it back every frame).
