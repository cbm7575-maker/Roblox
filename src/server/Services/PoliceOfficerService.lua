-- PoliceOfficerService (ModuleScript, ServerScriptService.Services.PoliceOfficerService)
-- Police officers on foot (owner, Oct 30: the police get out of their cars, chase, shoot when it's
-- called for, and arrest anyone who gives up). AIPoliceService's patrol cars carry them:
--   * Riding: one officer at the wheel, a second in the passenger seat from 3 stars (Board). A rider is a
--     posed statue welded in the seat for everyone to see (no Humanoid: one welded into a car pushes it
--     about; VehicleService.SeatNPC does the same for taxi fares).
--   * Out: once the car has pulled up within K.DISMOUNT studs of the suspect and slowed down, and the
--     suspect is on foot or sitting in a car that has stopped, the officers step out by their doors as
--     real walking officers (Humanoids in Workspace.NPCs, server-owned). The car waits there with its
--     lights on (AIPoliceService.drive holds it while Step says "out"). When the suspect drives off or
--     gets K.REMOUNT studs from the car, they run back and get in, and the car takes up the chase.
--   * What an officer does depends on what the suspect does (step):
--       - Hands up (player attribute Surrender: H / gamepad Y / the HANDS UP tile, LawClient ->
--         RequestSurrender, handled here): they hold fire, walk up and cuff them K.SURRENDER_CUFF seconds
--         after reaching them. A surrender also takes a star off the sentence (ArrestService).
--       - Standing still (or sitting in a stopped car, or tasered) with no threat: they run up ("POLICE!
--         HANDS UP!") and cuff them after K.CUFF seconds at arm's length (K.CUFF_CAR from the side of the
--         car: walking straight at the driver shoved it down the road; within K.CUFF_RISE up or down and
--         with a clear line, so never through a floor or a wall): ArrestService.Arrest, as ever.
--         Moving off again breaks it: the cuff timer runs back down, twice as fast as it filled.
--       - Running: they chase at K.RUN, a little under a sprinting player, and TASER them (owner, Nov 2:
--         a sprinter simply got away). An officer out of the car for K.TASER_AFTER seconds with a clear
--         line to an unarmed runner on foot within K.TASER_RANGE studs shouts "TASER!" and holds it out
--         (the pistol part turned yellow, with the "aim" arm) for K.TASER_WINDUP seconds while he keeps
--         running: the suspect sees it coming, and stopping, sitting down or putting the hands up then
--         calls the shot off. Then he fires (and waits K.TASER_COOLDOWN, counted from the shout): a hit
--         is likelier the closer they are, K.TASER_HIT_NEAR at arm's length down to K.TASER_HIT_FAR at
--         K.TASER_REACH studs, none further (the wire falls short). A hit stuns them for K.TASER_STUN
--         seconds the way a player cop's taser does: the player attribute StunnedUntil (server time),
--         which the suspect's own LawClient reads to lay the body down and hold it there, and which
--         every move, tool, seat and hands-up check reads. (WalkSpeed is left alone: ArrestService saves
--         it and gives it back for its own stun, so nobody already stunned or knocked down is tasered
--         here, and its stun is never stretched by ours.) A stunned suspect is standing still, so the
--         cuffing above follows; the officer keeps running at them until close. Remote TaserFx (officer
--         Model, suspect) shows the wire to everyone and plays the zap and the "ZAPPED!" toast as for a
--         player cop's taser (LawClient, SoundClient); a miss sends (officer Model, false, where the wire
--         ended). Never at someone in a seat, in a safe zone, with their hands up or a gun out, or
--         hostile (they get the pistol, below).
--       - Hostile (hostileTo): a gun out at 2+ stars, a gun fired in the last K.FIRED_MEMORY seconds, an
--         officer shot or punched by them in the last K.ASSAULT_MEMORY seconds, or 4+ stars. They draw
--         their pistols, keep K.KEEP_NEAR..K.KEEP_FAR studs off with a clear line, and shoot every
--         K.SHOT_GAP seconds; how often a shot lands goes down with distance and a running target
--         (CombatService.PoliceShot does the damage, the shot effects for everyone, and the death: with
--         police right there that is an arrest on the spot, ArrestService.GaveUp). Never at someone in a
--         car seat (players can't be hit there either), in a safe zone, or with their hands up.
--       - A gun out at 1 star: drawn but holding fire ("DROP THE WEAPON!").
--   * Players can shoot and punch them (CombatService routes hits on Workspace.NPCs models with the
--     attribute NPCKind = "Officer" to PoliceOfficerService.NPCHit): K.HEALTH health; fists knock one out
--     for K.PUNCH_DOWN seconds (the limp fall: Shared.Util.Ragdoll), bullets can kill. Either costs stars
--     (CombatService.CrimeHeat; a dead officer is one more real star: HeatService.Add) and turns every
--     officer on that player hostile.
--   * Shouts: a bubble over the head ("POLICE! HANDS UP!"), and the suspect's own toast says how to give
--     up (Notify "PoliceOnFoot", once per patrol). "TASER!" always shows (the others wait K.SAY_GAP).
--   * The suspect's cuff bar: while a walking officer's cuff timer runs on a wanted player, the player
--     attribute CuffProgress (0..1 in 0.05 steps; the furthest along when several officers are at it)
--     tells their LawClient, which draws BEING CUFFED with a bar ("RUN to break free" unless the hands
--     are up). nil the rest of the time, set every K.TICK by a loop of its own (Init), so officers who
--     go (back in the car, down, removed) take it with them. A Coast Guard boat arresting a boat's
--     driver feeds the same bar (BoatCuff, from AIPoliceService): its officers stay aboard.
--   * Walking officers are HeatService eyes, like the patrol cars, and carry the attribute AimTarget
--     (CombatClient's AIM swing can lock onto them). Riders don't (bullets pass through them to the car).
-- Look: navy uniform (body colours), a cap, a gold badge, POLICE on the back, a pistol that shows only
-- when drawn (with Roblox's stock R15 "tool" arm), or yellow as the taser while that is out. Four looks
-- are built at start-up (OfficerTemplates in ServerStorage); until they are ready a patrol simply has
-- nobody in it and arrests from the car as before.
-- Public (AIPoliceService): Board(car, count) -> crew or nil, Step(crew, dt, target, info, carSpeed) ->
-- "ride" | "out" | "gone", Remove(crew). CombatService: NPCHit(model, attacker, damage, dir, kind) -> bool.
