--                                   the robbery / theft stays up.
--   3. Cash in your bag          -> "Bank $X at the Hideout" (GPS to the Hideout)
--   4. Driving a boosted hot car -> "Take it to the Chop Shop", "At the Docks..." (GPS to the Chop Shop)

-- title after its tag, 38 for a second line; with the SHOW ME chip below about 6 and 8 fewer, which
-- the Chop Shop lines are written for): the strip never wraps and cuts the rest with "...".
-- SHOW ME for the Chop Shop: whenever the strip's next step is the Chop Shop (the WANTED, HOT CAR and
-- JACKED lines above that name it; a bag comes first and keeps its Hideout route), a SHOW ME chip with
-- its key cap sits at the strip's right end (button "ShowMe": "GO" on a narrow strip; no cap and
-- Theme.Touch big on touch screens) and it, J or gamepad L3 routes the GPS there. Shown even when the
-- GPS is already on it (the jack's suggestion usually is, and while wanted the readout is hidden: the
-- escape line has the Banner zone). It's the goal pill's own button and shortcut (TutorialClient),
-- which step aside with the pill while this strip has the Goal zone: right after a jack this strip
-- always has it (a street jack gives a star, then you're at the wheel), so the chop goal's SHOW ME and
-- J were out of reach just when they were needed. A route asked for this way is the player's own
-- (never cleared by an objective of ours; GPSClient drops it on arrival), and a toast says "GPS set".
-- Also: whenever you steal a hot car (BoostStolenAt changes, CarBoostService sets it on every theft)
-- a stamp says where to take it and the GPS is set. Jacking a car (Carjacked from CarjackService)
-- stamps "CAR JACKED" (or "CAR ALARM", in red) with its Chop Shop price, and routes the GPS to the Chop
-- Shop only as a suggestion: never over a target the player picked themselves, never over the route of
-- the objective on screen (e.g. the Hideout for a bag), never with cash in the bag, and not for a car
-- the Chop Shop won't buy.
-- Hidden during races, job shifts and missions (they have their own banners), for cops, and while the
-- first-join title screen is up (local attribute TitleScreen, set by TeamUI). Hidden too while you're on
-- the Big Score's roster (player attribute BigScore): BigScoreClient draws that heist's strip in this same
-- Goal zone, so Active() stays true meanwhile and the tutorial's goal keeps out of its way as well. Not in
-- prison, though (a prisoner stays on that roster): the vent strip comes first there.
-- Look and place ("street" HUD, Theme; re-placed when the screen size or input type changes):
--   * Frame "Banner" (the name MinimapClient / SoundClient look for) sits in the GOAL zone, top centre:
--     a slim flat dark strip with a thin colour bar at its left edge, a small Display tag in the colour
--     that means something (PRISON orange; WANTED white, red and blinking while a cop can see you; BAG,
--     HOT CAR and JACKED gold: a goal with a reward), one line of white words (bag cash and car values in
--     gold) and a dim second line. TutorialClient's goal / guide steps aside while it shows (Changed).
--   * Frame "Escape" (only while wanted) sits in the BANNER zone under it: text straight on the screen
--     with a soft shadow, a small word and a big Display value, both in the colour that means
--     something: "STAY HIDDEN 0:32" (dim word, white time), "PATROLS ARRIVE IN 0:12" (police blue),
--     "SEEN  BREAK LINE OF SIGHT" (red). The stars themselves are HUDController's (Status zone), so
--     they aren't repeated here.
--   Each steps aside while a HUDController stamp would draw over it (HUDController.StampTop; on phones
--   the Stamp zone reaches into the Banner zone, so the escape line steps aside for every stamp there),
--   then comes back; `active` stays true meanwhile. StampTop is in zone coordinates (y = 0 at the very
--   top of the screen), so the pieces are measured from this ScreenGui's own corner.
-- GPS rule: a target this module set is cleared when its objective ends; a target the player picked
-- themselves (GPSClient.Target() isn't the name we set, or they asked for it with the strip's SHOW ME)
-- is never cleared, and the jack's Chop Shop suggestion never goes over it (a SHOW ME press does).
-- Must start after HUDController and GPSClient in ClientMain's ORDER.
--   ObjectiveClient.Active() -> true while there is an objective (shown, or stepped aside for a stamp),
--     or the Big Score's strip has the Goal zone
--   ObjectiveClient.Changed  -> event(active), fired when that flips (TutorialClient listens)
--   ObjectiveClient.RouteTo(placeName) -> point the GPS at a place from MapService's "Places" list,
--     as ours; returns true if the route is set (HeistClient: "bank it at the Hideout (GPS set)").
--   ObjectiveClient.SetGoalPlace(show) -> TutorialClient: where the current free-roam goal's SHOW ME
--     points (Config.Journey Show), or nil; the chop goal ("Chop Shop") makes the Chop Shop a next step.
