-- HeistClient (ModuleScript, StarterPlayerScripts.Controllers.HeistClient)
-- Client side of heists, in the flat "street" look (Shared.Util.Theme):
--   * Rob prompts show only for robbers, and only while the site is Robbable (local-only toggle of
--     Enabled; the server re-checks everything when a robbery finishes). A prompt that streams in right
--     next to you is switched at once, not on the next pass (the server leaves it on for everybody).
--     A Rob prompt you are holding when its store leaves the rotation stays up until that hold ends
--     (stores shut for new holds only; the server pays a hold that began while the store was open).
--   * Sitting in a car (any seat) you can't rob: PromptGate hides the Rob and prep prompts the moment you
--     sit and brings them back when you stand up. It does that with MaxActivationDistance and this file
--     only ever sets Enabled, text and hold time, so the two never undo each other (nothing here looks at
--     the seat). InteractClient's "Get out to rob" hint asks HeistClient.NearestRob for the nearest spot
--     you could use on foot right now.
--   * Site signs (the server's BillboardGui over each pad, restyled on this device the first time it is
--     seen): the name in white Display, the state after it in the colour that means it, and a thin rule
--     in that colour under the words. "GLOW MART  OPEN" (green: cash to take), "GLOW MART  CLOSED 2:10"
--     (all dim; the same seated or on foot: the store is open, you just have to get out), and for cops
--     "GLOW MART  ALARM" blinking red while the alarm runs.
--   * Rank-locked heists (MinRank, e.g. the Coastal Bank at free-roam rank 3) say so up front for
--     players below it: the sign reads "COASTAL BANK / RANK 3 NEEDED (you're 1)" in purple, the prompts
--     read "Rank 3 needed" (a tap asks the server, which explains), and the first time you walk up to
--     one a stamp (the place over RANK 3 NEEDED) + toast tell you how to rank up.
--   * Prep panels (fuse box, yacht panel) with a live prep read "Done (1:05 left)" for the crew that
--     did it and "Taken (free in 0:32)" for everyone else while it's protected (PrepLockUntil); a tap
--     asks the server, which explains. Otherwise they show the server's own text and hold time.
--   * Heists with a prep step (Config.Heists Prep: the Coastal Bank's fuse box on its east wall, the Sea
--     Dream's alarm panel on the boarding deck) say so BEFORE anyone tries the vault. Until the prep is
--     this player's or their crew's and its window is open (PrepBy / PrepUntil: the server's own test,
--     HeistService prepIsMine), the Rob prompt is locked on this device: it reads "Cut the power first"
--     over "Fuse box: east wall" (K.PREP_WORDS) and has no hold, so E can't be held on it (a tap asks the
--     server, which says NeedPrep_<type>). The sign adds the step in gold under OPEN ("CUT THE POWER
--     FIRST"), or how long your window has left in green ("POWER OUT 1:05"); a gold marker ("CUT THE
--     POWER" over a chevron) floats over the panel for anyone within K.MARK_RANGE studs of it, drawn on
--     top of everything (the fuse box is round the outside of the bank); and the first walk-up to the
--     place says it in a toast. A prep done or redone, or a crew joined or left, re-labels it at once
--     (attribute signals); the pass catches a window running out. A hold already running is never
--     locked under your thumb: the server pays a hold that began inside the window.
--   * Holding a Rob prompt (ScreenGui "HeistUI", frame "Rob", in the Subtitle zone, or standing on top
--     of whatever else is using that zone): the place's name, the take so far counting up in green
--     ("$420 ...": the store's base payout times how far the hold has got; the real figure, with night /
--     crew / VIP bonuses and a big heist's crew split, comes with the result stamp) and a slim white bar
--     that thumps like a heartbeat, faster as the hold nears its end. The camera eases in up to 1.4 studs
--     while you hold and back out when you let go (moved after Roblox's camera each frame, so nothing
--     else's FOV or camera offset is touched). A prep panel's hold gets the same bar with a percentage
--     instead of cash.
--   * The alarm trips (the site's AlarmUntil starts, 10 s after the robbery): two quick red pulses round
--     the edge of the screen (frame "Alarm") for the robber and for anyone within 150 studs of the site.
--   * Result stamp (HUDController.Stamp, gold): "GLOW MART  ·  IN YOUR BAG" over ROBBERY COMPLETE (HEIST
--     COMPLETE for a big heist, CAR DELIVERED for a hot car), the reward line "+$1,200   +40 XP", then
--     "Lose the cops, then bank it at the Hideout (GPS set)" under it and the GPS pointed at the Hideout
--     through ObjectiveClient. A finished prep: STEP 1 DONE, green.
--   * Crew cuts (big heists only, HeistService): a robber who split the take (result Crew > 1) reads
--     "Split with 2 crewmates." before the next step. A crewmate who helped gets YOUR CUT (result Cut)
--     over the same place line, with the cash but no XP (the server gives the heist XP to the robber).
--   * Bag full: a toast with the cash left behind, and the Big Duffel offer is queued (OfferClient
--     shows it later, once the player isn't wanted or speeding).
--   * Big heists (Coastal Bank / Sea Dream, yours or your crew's: attribute BigHeists) say what they
--     count toward: "Big heist 1/3 toward the Riptide R", or which heist-locked ride just unlocked.
--   * Store clerks (HeistService; Heists.Types[...].Clerk): with a gun aimed at a clerk (CombatClient.Aiming)
--     within K.CLERK_REACH studs, the server is asked to start the robbery (RequestStoreRob, at most once a
--     second); its StoreRob "Start" runs the same bar as a hold, counting the take up for the fill time,
--     "Done" / "Fail" end it. While a clerk stands there, a player who owns a gun doesn't see the till's
--     Rob prompt (they're told once, near the store, to point the gun at the clerk); without a gun it
--     shows as before. The clerk's pose (model attribute Pose: HandsUp, Cower) is played here with
--     PoseClient, on every device.
--   * Club Nova's drill (Drill): its Rob prompt reads "Set the drill", then "Drilling 0:18" (locked) for
--     whoever set it and "Drill running" for everyone else, then "Grab the cash" for the driller.
--   HeistClient.NearestRob(pos, range)  studs from pos to the nearest Rob point or prep panel within
--                                       range that this player could use on foot right now, or nil
