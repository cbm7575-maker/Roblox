-- PhoneUI (ModuleScript, StarterPlayerScripts.Controllers.PhoneUI)
-- The in-game phone (the PHONE tile or P; a tap or click anywhere around it puts it away), drawn as a
-- modern smartphone in the flat "street" look
-- (Shared.Util.Theme): a slim dark body with a thin bezel and small corners, a status bar (the game's
-- clock from Lighting.ClockTime, your cash in a small island, signal bars and a battery drawn from
-- frames), a home screen (a dark wallpaper, a big clock when the screen is tall enough, and a grid of
-- flat square app icons: a white glyph drawn from frames on a coloured tile, a small label under it),
-- app pages with a clean header (back chevron, the title in the Display font) and list rows separated
-- by thin lines, flat buttons, and a home bar at the bottom (on a page: back to the home screen; on the
-- home screen: puts the phone away).
-- Raising it: the phone comes up from the lower right, tilted like a phone in a hand, and settles
-- upright in K.Raise seconds; putting it away is the reverse (K.Lower). A turned frame can't clip what
-- is inside it, so the page is hidden and the glass stays dark while the phone moves, and the screen
-- lights up once it is upright. While it is up your character holds a phone and looks down at it, legs
-- still walking (PoseClient's "PhoneLook", shown to everyone; not while seated, and nothing happens if
-- that controller isn't there).
-- Sizes: the phone is laid out at a fixed design width (K.W) and a UIScale ("Fit") shrinks it on small
-- screens (0.7 on a phone). Tap targets are at least Theme.Touch REAL pixels tall after that scale
-- (touchHeight) and text at least K.MinText real pixels (textPx), so pages measure their rows from those
-- two instead of fixed numbers, and rows with sentences in them size themselves to their words. A new
-- screen size draws the open page again.
-- Its right edge stays left of the HUD's Buttons zone (bodyRight), so the PHONE / CAR tiles stay usable.
-- Putting it away by tapping around it: nothing is laid over the screen for that, so every HUD button
-- works as before whether the phone is up or not. A quick tap or click (K.TapTime, K.TapSlop) that no
-- GUI took (the street, the sky, a plain label) and that lands outside the phone's body closes it; taps
-- on the phone itself (S.phoneTouchAt), drags (thumbstick, camera) and long presses never do.
-- Apps:
--   GARAGE    your cars for your current role (bought, starter, game-pass and cop-rank cars): DELIVER
--             (spawn), STYLE: paint and rims are owned per car (a new colour $500 / rim style $1,500
--             once on that car, then switching back is free; the car's stock paint and chrome rims are
--             always owned; pass and unlock ones are free once you have them), underglow $3,000 once
--             per car, then free colour swaps (Config.Garage's STYLE notes; GarageService charges by the
--             same Garage.StyleCost). Thumb-sized swatches with a caption under each: its price, OWNED,
--             STOCK, FREE, ON (the one fitted: white ring) or what unlocks it (padlock). A swatch that
--             costs money takes two taps: the first arms it (green ring, AGAIN, "TAP AGAIN TO BUY"
--             above the grid, for K.StyleArmTime seconds), only the second sends the request, so one
--             tap never spends anything. Boats have no STYLE (their hulls keep the factory colours).
--             TUNE (a strip on every land car that isn't a police car, so the page is two taps from
--             the home screen; it reads SPEED + SOUND on a stock car): AUTO TUNE on top (shows its
--             total and what it buys, second tap confirms), bars for top speed / acceleration /
--             braking / grip / nitro (white = stock, pink = tuned; each bar is scaled to THIS car,
--             from 70% of stock to fully tuned, so every stage is a step you can see; the numbers on
--             the right stay absolute), the exhaust picker right under them so both halves of
--             "faster and better sounding" are on the first screen (sound only: bought once per car,
--             then free swaps), then the five upgrade tracks with stage pips, the next gain and its
--             price.
--             Exhausts: tapping a chip only ever plays its rev (the fitted one too, to compare), as
--             often as you like, and never costs anything. A chip that isn't bought yet is then
--             offered on the BUY button in the picker's head row ("BUY $8,000" over "RACE", for
--             EXHAUST_PICK_TIME seconds; the chip gets a thin pink line): that button is the only
--             thing that pays for an exhaust, so listening again can't buy one by mistake. A chip
--             bought earlier fits with one tap (free).
--             Buying an upgrade works like a tuning shop: the first tap turns the button green (TAP
--             AGAIN) and shows the gain before you pay, as a see-through pink piece on the bars and
--             the new number in pink; the second tap sends it and the button reads FITTING... until
--             the server answers (a refusal or no answer puts it back). Then the engine revs in the
--             car's own exhaust note (SoundClient.PreviewExhaust), a toast shows, the row flashes
--             and the bars glide to their new length. Prices, gains and the plan AUTO TUNE shows
--             come from Config.Garage, the same helpers GarageService charges with. Each request
--             says what the button showed (the stage, or the stages AUTO TUNE started from), so a
--             second try after a slow answer never buys the next, dearer thing (GarageService).
--             Theme's see-through black can't be seen on the phone's near-black screen, so the page's
--             quiet buttons and its stat panel use Theme's lighter panel colour (lift / tuneButton;
--             every other page's quiet buttons get the same look from flat) and a bar's empty part is
--             dim grey, like an empty stage pip. The page's code sits in one block between the "TUNE
--             page" banner and placePos and keeps its own constants and state as locals, so it can be
--             worked on by itself. Its text floor is K.TuneMinText real pixels, not K.MinText: its
--             chips and columns were measured for that.
--   AUTONEON  browse every car and boat (class, four small stat bars, price or lock); buying happens in
--             person, so each row's button routes you to AutoNeon Motors (cars) or Marina Boat Sales
--   HOME      homes for sale (HouseClient): price, garage size, distance, GPS to the door, GO HOME
--   GPS       races, stunts, jobs, services and heist sites (open ones marked): sets a road route
--   JOBS      police duty, an optional job (GO ON DUTY / GO OFF DUTY: RequestTeam; TeamService checks
--             heat, the cooldown and the cop cap and says why in a toast; the phone goes away when the
--             switch lands), the three street jobs, and the phone missions. Everyone joins free roam.
--   SHOP      every game pass and cash pack with its Robux price (Config.Shop's until the item has a
--             real Id, then read live from Roblox): OWNED, BUY (Roblox's prompt), SOON ("Coming soon"
--             while the Id is 0) or FREE in Studio and for the game's owner (player attribute
--             "ShopFree", ShopService: RequestShopFree, checked on the server); cash packs add cash
--             only (they can't skip heist locks, cop ranks or passes)
--   GOALS     both ranks with their XP bars and next unlock, and today's challenges
--   CREW      INVITE FRIENDS (Roblox's own invite pop-up, hidden when Roblox says this player can't send
--             invites), THE BIG SCORE (the crew heist, BigScoreService: one line on whether you could
--             start it right now, worked out here from your crew, rank, cooldown and whether another
--             crew is on it, its countdown kept fresh in place; START, or QUIT with a second tap while
--             you're on it), crew invites for players here, friends in other servers of the game with JOIN
--             (FriendsService teleports), and the play-together bonus and Squad paint progress
--   SETTINGS  radio and sound volume, performance mode, passive mode (and the key list on a keyboard)
-- Under the apps, HOW TO PLAY opens a guide to every feature: topic chips at the top jump to short
-- sections with GPS and OPEN buttons (a page opened from it goes Back to it; put away on it, it reopens
-- there for a while). Touch players see their on-screen buttons instead of keys, and the street-car lines
-- only show once CarjackService runs. The button pulses the first time the home screen shows each
-- session. Where a number the guide quotes lives in a shared config, it's read from there.
-- Hidden vehicles (Config.Vehicles Hidden = true: street-only cars) never show in any list here.
-- The server decides everything (GarageService, VehicleService); this only sends requests.
-- Gamepad / keyboard UI navigation: a redraw keeps the selection on the same button (show finds its
-- twin on the new page), and a new page, or the phone opening while something else is selected,
-- moves it to the page's first button; Close lets go of it. Two-press buys (TUNE) need that: the first
-- press redraws the page. Gamepad B, while a phone button is selected and you aren't seated, goes Back
-- (or puts the phone away on the home screen). Gamepad D-pad down raises the phone, and puts it away
-- while none of its buttons is selected; raised that way on foot, the selection goes to the page's first
-- button (not in a car: B gets out there). Never while the dressing room is open (WardrobeUI).
-- PhoneUI.Open(pageName?, arg?): pageName is one of PAGES' keys ("Garage", "Shop", "Goals"...; none =
-- the home screen). "Tune" and "Custom" open on one car's page: arg = its vehicle id (the dealer's
-- TUNE IT button uses PhoneUI.Open("Tune", id)). On a phone that is already up, Open just changes the
-- page. PhoneUI.Close(), Toggle(), IsOpen() (false from the moment it is put away; "Body" stays Visible
-- a moment longer while it slides out).
-- Names other code and the Studio test tools use (keep them): ScreenGui "Phone" > "PhoneButton" (the
-- HUD tile, HUDController.ZoneButton) and "Body" (OfferClient, MinimapClient, AmbienceClient,
-- DealerClient and TutorialClient watch its Visible) > "Fit", "Back", "HomeBar" and "Screen" > the page.
-- Home screen: "Apps".<page key>, "Guide", "GuideHint". Pages: "List".<row>.<button>: Garage
-- List.<carId>.Deliver / Style / Tune; STYLE List.Paint / Rims / Underglow > Frame.Swatch<n> and Status
-- (Paint's Swatch1 is the car's stock colour, so paint i is Swatch<i + 1>; Rims and Underglow start at 1);
