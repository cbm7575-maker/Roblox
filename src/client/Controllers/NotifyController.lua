-- NotifyController (ModuleScript, StarterPlayerScripts.Controllers.NotifyController)
-- Personal toast messages in the HUD's Toasts zone ("street" look, Shared.Util.Theme): small flat dark
-- cards with a thin coloured bar down the left edge and a small icon for the category (warning !,
-- police ★, prison #, money $, success ✓, info i, crew +), white Body text. Colour means something:
-- orange = a problem, red = the cops, green = cash / done, gold = a reward, grey = information.
-- A card slides in and fades in, then fades out after ~4 s; at most 3 show at once.
--   PC / gamepad: bottom-left, the stack grows UP from just above the minimap (newest at the bottom),
--     never higher than SPLIT of the screen height (the Coast Feed's column comes down to there).
--   Phone: top-left, the stack grows DOWN from under the minimap and vitals (newest on top) and stops
--     well above Roblox's thumbstick. The Coast Feed's posts join this same stack on phones, and on a PC
--     whose chat window covers the feed's own column (Stack, as "low" cards).
--   When the stack runs out of room (or has 3 cards) a card goes: the oldest feed post first, else the
--   oldest toast. Your own toasts always win over feed posts, so a post that finds the stack full of
--   them is dropped (it stays in the phone's Feed app); otherwise the newest card always shows. It is
--   re-placed when the screen size or input type changes.
-- The server sends a key (never raw text); the words live in Messages so they're easy to change.
-- Toasts never take touches (Active = false, no buttons), so they can't block a tap on a phone.
-- Public API:
--   NotifyController.Messages                      key -> text
--   NotifyController.Categories                    key -> category ("warning", "police", "prison",
--                                                  "money", "success", "info", "crew")
--   NotifyController.Show(text, color?, category?) a toast. color: optional accent for non-alert
--                                                  categories (old neon colours are fine: see Tone);
--                                                  category: guessed from the words when left out.
--   NotifyController.Stack(slot, fade, lifetime?, low?)  put a ready-made card in the stack
--                                                  (FeedController): slot = a Frame (Size 1,0,0,0,
--                                                  AutomaticSize Y) holding a Frame "Card"; fade = {
--                                                  [instance] = { prop = hidden value } } for every property
--                                                  that fades in and out (built in its shown state);
--                                                  lifetime in seconds; low = true for a card that gives way
--                                                  to toasts (feed posts). The slot is destroyed if it
--                                                  can't get in.
--   NotifyController.Tone(color) -> the Theme colour that means the same as a caller's colour (old neon
--                                                  pink / mint / gold / orange / red...), or nil for none
