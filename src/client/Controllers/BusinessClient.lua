-- BusinessClient (ModuleScript, StarterPlayerScripts.Controllers.BusinessClient)
-- The client side of Empire, player businesses (Config.Businesses; BusinessService on the server decides
-- everything and checks every request again). Does nothing at all while ReplicatedStorage attribute
-- BusinessesOn isn't true (the launch switch: see Config.Businesses.Live).
--
-- THE CARDS (ScreenGui "Business", DisplayOrder 9, the flat "street" look of HouseClient's buy card; frame
-- "Card"). Opened by the server's BusinessCard (the door prompt). On a PC: top-left under Roblox's top bar,
-- Roblox's chat window hidden while it's open; on a phone: centred, Theme.Touch-tall buttons, CLOSE / CANCEL
-- on the left (the thumb side). Walking off the lot (the server's Reach) or sitting down closes it. Keys: X / gamepad B
-- close it, Enter / gamepad Y press its first button (never while seated or from behind Roblox's menu).
--   * BUY card (not yours): the name and price, the job in one line with its pay, the register (trickle a
--     minute and its size), the blurb, the level-5 picture in words; BUY (NEED $X MORE / EMPIRE n NEEDED) and
--     CANCEL.
--   * MANAGE card (yours): the name and LEVEL n, five level pips, the trickle (+25% while a crewmate is here),
--     the register filling live with its bar, what the next level adds and costs; COLLECT $X | START JOB,
--     UPGRADE $X | CLOSE. START JOB turns the buttons into the business's jobs (Config Jobs: WASH A CAR |
--     DELIVER A CAR at the Car Wash), BACK | CLOSE; with only one job (Palm Grind's RUSH ORDERS) it starts it.
--   * CREW card (a crewmate owns it): "<Owner>'s Suds & Shine", their level, what working here pays both of
--     you; its jobs (WASH A CAR | DELIVER A CAR, or RUSH ORDERS), BUY YOUR OWN | CLOSE.
--   The card counts as a panel: BusinessClient.IsOpen() (CombatClient lowers the gun, InteractClient offers
--   no E / F behind it). The wash mini-game counts too while a car is in the bay.
--
-- THE WASH BAY (BusinessJob "Wash"): the customer car exists only on this device (a ReplicatedStorage
-- TrafficModels body in a random paint, or a greybox car, in Workspace "BizLocal"): it rolls into the bay
-- the server picked, with its tag over it ("Carla's sedan"; a special customer's name and what it pays: a muddy
-- truck is a pickup, a wedding car white with a JUST MARRIED board, a classic car mint, cream or cherry) and
-- 4-7 dirty spots, each the server's dirt (mud, bugs or bird mess: its own look, colour and taps).
-- SPRAY and RINSE are timing gauges (the Print Shop's: Job.band / Job.drawGauge): hold the HOLD button (Theme's
-- Action zone; F on a keyboard, RT on a gamepad), the fill goes grey, green in the band, orange past it; water
-- from the bay's nozzle and the hose's hiss (Sounds WashHiss) while held. The server grades it: PERFECT! / OK /
-- TOO EARLY pops over the button (Job.pop; a ding for PERFECT). SCRUB: tap each spot's round button ("BIRD ×4"):
-- a squeak and a puff of suds, the spot shrinks and fades, the last tap a sparkle pop (Sounds WashSqueak,
-- WashPop); Wash.spread keeps the buttons apart on screen (the Nov 4 Studio test: two could overlap on a phone).
-- Every step goes to the server (RequestBusiness "Step"); its "WashStep" answer puts the game back where the
-- server is when a step didn't count. Paid ("WashPaid"): the shine sweep and sparkle, the ★ / ★★ / ★★★ rating
-- slamming down over the car (the server's), the pay counting up, and the AFTER panel (the pay, the stars, the
-- tip's story: "tip $192 · streak ×1.1"): NEXT CAR | DELIVER | END. The washed car honks twice as it pulls out.
-- DETAIL DELIVERY ("Detail"): the GPS routes to the customer's address, a gold ring and beam mark it, the
-- strip counts down the tip, the line under it counts the dents ("DENTS 0": red and shaking at a dent; "SPORTS
-- CAR" for the sports car the server sometimes hands you). "DetailPaid": the customer walks out to the car and
-- waves (a few local parts), the car fades, the DELIVERED · NO DENTS (or -2 DENTS) stamp with the stars and the
-- streak; the shift goes on: the GPS back, and at the business (on foot) the AFTER panel again.
-- RUSH ORDERS (Palm Grind, M2; BusinessJob "Rush" / "RushStep" / "RushLeg" / "RushPaid"): at the counter, the
-- HOLD button shows within K.GRAB_RANGE of the RUSH ORDERS shelf (on foot): hold it (F / RT / mouse / finger)
-- for Config.Rush.GrabHold to grab an order (RequestBusiness "Step" GrabOn / GrabOff; the server times it and
-- answers "RushStep" Again when it didn't count). Each address ("RushLeg"): the ring and beam, the GPS, and the
-- strip's coffee cup (draining hot to cold as the clock runs) and "PROFESSOR LANE · ICED LATTE" (a VIP: "VIP ·
-- STELLA STARR" and a gold edge round the strip), the clock counting down on the right (the tip it would pay now
-- on a PC: Businesses.RushTip, the server's own maths; LATE once it runs out); the line under it: a multi-stop
-- order's pips ("1/3 DELIVERED"), the gold streak, RUSH HOUR and its clock. "RushPaid": the medal stamp (GOLD /
-- SILVER / BRONZE, the server's) and a cup popping up at the door; after the order's last stop PERFECT RUN (all
-- GOLD: the bonus), VIP DELIVERED (confetti) or the medal with ORDER DELIVERED; then the GPS back to the café.
-- RUSH HOUR (BusinessResult "RushHour" / "RushHourOver"; the owner's attribute BizRushHour): a stamp on the job,
-- a toast otherwise.
-- THE PRINT SHOP (M3; BusinessJob "Print" / "PrintStep" / "Printed" / "Loaded" / "Spotted" / "Laundered" /
-- "BagsLost" / "BagsBack"; the server decides everything: Services.BusinessJobs.PrintShop). One shift, two jobs:
--   * PRINT, a timing game: at each of the three stations (in order) the HOLD button shows within K.STATION_SHOW
--     (on foot). It's a gauge: it fills over the station's Full seconds with a green band (Config.Print.Stations
--     Sweet) drawn in it; the fill turns green inside the band, orange past it, and lets go by itself when full.
--     The server times and grades it ("PrintStep" Grade): a pop over the button says PERFECT! (with the streak
--     multiplier from 2 in a row; a ding) / OK / TOO EARLY. The strip shows the streak (×1.15) or the stock.
--     A press run ("Printed"): the press's ka-chunk (Sounds "Stamp"), sheets fluttering out of the tray (one
--     ParticleEmitter, a burst), a "+$1,600 DIRTY" pop rising over it, and the stack of fake bills on the counting
--     table growing (Print.cash: at most K.CASH_MAX parts, under the camera, only within K.CASH_RANGE).
--   * LAUNDER: the strip walks you through it (PARK YOUR CAR IN THE BAY, WALK TO THE CASH CART, HOLD TO LOAD THE
--     BAGS); "Loaded": the drop's ring, beam and GPS, "DROP AT THE ARCADE" with the distance, and the HEAT meter
--     under the strip (player attribute BizHeat, the server's: gold, orange from 40%, red from 75%; SPOTTED when
--     wanted). "Laundered": the clean cash counts up on screen (a cash register), the LAUNDERED stamp with the pay,
--     "clean run · bonus $X" when you were never spotted.
--   * The end ("Ended" with a Summary): the SHIFT REPORT card below (press runs, PERFECTs, the best streak, runs,
--     clean runs, $ printed and earned).
--   * RAIDS (ReplicatedStorage BizRaids; BusinessResult Raid / RaidBreached / RaidSeized / RaidHeld / RaidOver): the
--     warning or the dispatch toast and the GPS, the strip's red RAID countdown (owner and crew: RAID! GET TO YOUR
--     PRINT SHOP / HOLD THE DOOR! / COPS BREAKING IN 40%; a cop: BREACH THE PRINT SHOP DOOR / SEARCH THE PRESSES),
--     a siren loop at the shop within K.SIREN_RANGE, the AI car's light bar flashing, the map icon flashing red
--     (BizAlarm), and the endings: SEIZED $X (a cop's stamp, with the reward), RAIDED (the owner), RAID FAILED (the
--     owner and the crew who held the door, with the bonus and XP). The raid prompts (BizBreachPrompt,
--     BizSearchPrompt) are switched on only on an eligible cop's device; during a warrant the door's own prompt
--     steps aside there so E is BREACH. The manage card and the EMPIRE app show the dirty cash and the raid.
-- BOAT TOURS (Coastline Boat Rentals, M4; BusinessJob "Tour" / "TourSeat" / "TourGo" / "TourStop" / "TourPhotoOn" /
-- "TourPhoto" / "TourMood" / "TourPaid"; the server decides everything: Services.BusinessJobs.BoatRentals).
--   * At the dock ("Tour" Stage "board"): WALK TO THE BOAT with the distance until you're at the helm (the boat's
--     "Drive" bubble shows only to you), then ALL ABOARD... while the tourists hop on. A special tour says so in a
--     toast (CELEBRITY TOUR with the star's name, FISHING PARTY, SUNSET TOUR) and on the line under the strip.
--   * "TourGo": the ship's horn (Sounds TourHorn), ALL ABOARD! over the HOLD spot, and the route: BUOY RINGS on the
--     water (local parts under the camera: a see-through ring wall, K.BUOYS bobbing buoys, a name tag; gold for a
--     landmark, pink for a PHOTO STOP, green for a FISHING STOP, aqua for the dock; the next one bright with a light
--     pillar, the one after it dim) and a white GPS line on the water (GPSClient.SetPath, K.TOUR_PATH, with Height:
--     the next three stops and the dock; redrawn from the boat when it's K.OFF_LINE off it).
--   * The strip: NEXT: THE SEA DREAM and the distance; PHOTO STOP: SLOW DOWN! near a photo ring; inside it HOLD IT
--     STEADY... / SLOWER FOR A PERFECT SHOT / TOO FAST! with the PHOTO gauge under the line (the Print Shop's heat
--     bar: green under the PERFECT speed, orange under the photo speed, red too fast; this device's own reading of
--     the server's Businesses.PhotoStep); BACK TO THE DOCK, STOP IN THE DOCK RING; GET BACK IN THE BOAT! when out.
--     The line under it: HAPPY 92% (the tourists' mood, player attribute BizTourHappy: green, orange, red), STOP
--     2/5, PAR 0:21 (or +0:05), the special, the streak.
--   * Every ring passed bursts; the TOUR GUIDE's line for that landmark pops up in a bubble under the strip for
--     K.GUIDE_TIME. A photo graded ("TourPhoto"): PERFECT SHOT! / NICE SHOT! / MISSED THE PHOTO! (fishing: CAUGHT A
--     BIG ONE! / A NIBBLE! / THEY GOT AWAY!), the screen's camera flashes with the shutter (Sounds TourShutter; the
--     tourists' heads flash for everyone on the server). "TourMood": the line under the strip shakes (a crash for a
--     ram, a splash and a toast for running aground; the tourist's shout is the server's bubble).
--   * "TourPaid": the ★ / ★★ / ★★★ TOUR stamp with the tip, bonus and streak, the pay counting up, confetti for
--     ★★★; then ("Tour" Stage "after", once the tourists have stepped off and cheered) the AFTER panel: the pay, the
--     stars and what was missing for ★★★ ("for ★★★: faster, PERFECT photos, a smoother ride"), NEXT TOUR | END.
-- THE JET SKI RENTAL (BusinessResult "Rented" / "RentalWarn" / "RentalOver"; player attribute BizRentalUntil): a toast
-- when you rent one, the strip's RENTAL line counting the time down (orange in the last minute) whenever no job or
-- alarm has the strip, a toast at a minute left and one when it goes back.
-- VIP PICKUPS (the Afterglow Nightclub, M5; BusinessJob "Vip" / "VipAboard" / "VipPap" / "VipLost" / "VipComfort" /
-- "VipPaid"; the server decides everything: Services.BusinessJobs.Nightclub).
--   * The pickup ("Vip" Stage "pickup"): GET IN THE LIMO until you're at its wheel (its "Drive" bubble shows only to
--     you), then PICK UP <NAME> · <THE VILLA> with the distance, the gold ring and beam at the pickup and the GPS. A
--     special VIP says so in a toast (SUPERSTAR, TABLOID STAR, LATE FOR THE SHOW) and on the line under the strip.
--   * "VipAboard": VIP ABOARD! over the HOLD spot, the door and a honk, what the VIP said; then TO THE RED CARPET with
--     the distance, the GPS to the club and the VIP mark at the carpet (a pink ring the size of a GOOD stop, a gold dot
--     for PERFECT, a beam). The line under it: COMFORT 92% (player attribute BizVipComfort: green, orange, red), PAR,
--     PAPARAZZI!, the special, NIGHT ×1.25, the streak. Near the club: STOP ON THE VIP MARK.
--   * "VipPap": PAPARAZZI! (a toast and the Spotted beep), the strip's LOSE THE PAPARAZZI! with the nearest one's
--     distance (cars with attribute BizPapFor = you). "VipLost": the LOST THEM! stamp and the LostCops sting.
--     "VipComfort": the line under the strip shakes (a crash sound, a camera flash for paparazzi).
--   * "VipPaid": the RED CARPET: the press's flashes on screen (Tour.flashes), the Passed sting, the ★ / ★★ / ★★★ RED
--     CARPET stamp with the stop (PERFECT / GOOD / OK STOP), the tip, LOST THEM, night, the streak; the pay counting up,
--     confetti for ★★★. Then ("Vip" Stage "after", once the VIP has walked in) the AFTER panel: NEXT VIP | END.
-- THE CLUB (BusinessResult "ClubIn" / "ClubOut" / "BoothBooked" / "BoothCrew" / "BoothWarn" / "BoothOver" / "Washed";
-- player attributes BizClub, BizCoverUntil, BizBoothUntil): the toasts; the rope's prompt reads "Cover charge $50", or
-- "Enter the club (free)" for owners and their crew, "(paid)" with a pass. Inside (BizClub): the strip says AFTERGLOW ·
-- DANCE FLOOR (or YOUR VIP BOOTH and its clock), END JOB reads LEAVE (RequestBusiness "Mod", id, "Leave"), and this
-- device makes the dance floor's tiles and the wall lights pulse (level 2+, its own level). The back room's WASH prompt
-- shows only to the club's owners; the card and the EMPIRE app show the back room's dirty cash, the wash and a raid.
-- The job's line (frame "Strip", Theme's Banner zone: a gold tag and what to do, at most K.STRIP_MAX letters; the
-- distance or the tip on the right; frame "StripSub" under it) and END JOB (a tile in the side column under the
-- Buttons zone, LawClient.SideSlot) show for the whole job. "Ended" says why, and THE SHIFT REPORT (frame
-- "ShiftReport", centred on every device): SHIFT REPORT · <BRAND>, the money counting up, the shift's numbers (the
-- server's Report or Summary: cars washed, ★★★, best streaks, deliveries, dents; orders, stops, medals, perfect
-- runs; press runs...), the Empire XP, CONTINUE (the same job again at the business, else the GPS back) | DONE
-- (Enter / Y, X / B). It goes by itself after K.REPORT_TIME or when you sit down.
--
-- COLD BREW (BusinessResult "ColdBrew"): a toast with what it does; another when it wears off (player
-- attribute ColdBrewUntil, server time; LocomotionClient reads the same attribute for the stamina).
--
-- PER-DEVICE LEVEL PROPS: every part tagged "BizProp" (attributes BizId, MinLevel, MaxLevel) is shown only
-- while the level this device shows for that business is within MinLevel..MaxLevel; else it's made fully
-- see-through and its gui, lights, decals and textures are switched off on this device only (nothing
-- replicates). The level shown: your own if you own it; else your crewmate's (the highest crewmate owner in
-- the server, from ReplicatedStorage "BizOwners"); else the featured owner's; else 1. The owner plate under
-- the roof sign says "★ YOUR SUDS & SHINE ★", "<Crewmate>'s Suds & Shine", "<Featured>'s Suds & Shine" or
-- FOR SALE · $25,000. Door prompts read Manage / Work here / View / Buy $X; the shine prompt only shows while
-- you drive your own car (not a boat); a customer car's "Drive" prompt only to its driver.
--
-- SHINE SPARKLE: cars (Workspace.Vehicles) within K.SHINE_RANGE of the camera whose owner's ShineUntil is in
-- the future get a sparkle emitter on their chassis and glossier paint, on this device (at most K.SHINE_MAX).
--
-- BREAK-INS: BusinessResult "BreakIn" (yours or a crewmate's): a toast, a GPS route to the business, the
-- strip's red BREAK-IN line with the time left (when no other job line is up), the map icon flashing red
-- (player attribute BizAlarm). A gun pointed at a robber (CombatClient.Aiming, within K.SCARE_REACH and
-- K.SCARE_CONE, once a second) asks the server to scare it off; punches and shots go through CombatService
-- as usual. Robbers' poses (model attribute Pose) play here with PoseClient, like HeistClient's clerks.
--
-- TOASTS AND STAMPS (BusinessResult): bought (a stamp), upgraded (LEVEL n, what it adds), collected, register
-- full, a customer ("Player2 got a shine at your Car Wash +$70", "...a cold brew at your Coffee Shop +$42"),
-- shined, cold brew, crew cut, break-in, stopped, lost, EMPIRE RANK n (a stamp, with what it unlocks), and
-- every refusal in words (K.MSG).
--
-- API (PhoneUI's EMPIRE app, MinimapClient, MapClient, CombatClient, InteractClient):
--   BusinessClient.On() -> the feature runs in this server
--   BusinessClient.IsOpen() -> a card, the wash mini-game, the rush orders' GRAB hold at the shelf, or the
--     Print Shop's HOLD (a station, the cash cart) is up
--   BusinessClient.Owned() -> { { Id, Name, Short, Level, Register (live), Cap, Rate, Busy, Next, Lifetime,
--     JobsDone, Pos, and for a shady business Dirty, Stock, Extra (the EMPIRE app's line: the dirty cash, or
--     RAID! and the clock), ExtraColor } } in config order
--   BusinessClient.ForSale() -> { { Id, Name, Price, Unlock, Locked, Pos, JobLine, Trickle } } (Enabled, not yours; a
--     locked one's JobLine starts "Unlocks at Empire 2 (you're 1)", M4)
--   BusinessClient.ComingSoon() -> { { Id, Name, Price, Unlock, JobLine, Kind } } (not Enabled yet)
--   BusinessClient.Empire() -> { Rank, XP, Share, Into, Need, Next (the next unlock's words), Title, RemoteCollect }
--   BusinessClient.RouteTo(id) -> GPS to its door; BusinessClient.Collect(id) -> remote collect (Empire 5+)
--   BusinessClient.MapBlips() -> { { Id, Name, Pos, Letter, Color, Owned, Alarm } } (Enabled businesses)
-- Studio: the phone layout follows PreviewTouch like every HUD piece; BizTestCrew (Workspace attribute) makes
-- every other player count as a crewmate here too.
